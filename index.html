            C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

            C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
        </p>

        <p>
            C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.[13] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule[14] with C++23 as the next planned standard.

        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>To get started with writing C++, open the CodeBlocks and write your first "Hello world" C++ code:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
            #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;
                
                int main() {
                  cout << "Hello World!";
                  return 0;
                }</pre
          >
        </code>
        <p>
            The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions";[10] and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages."

            A variable is a place where you can store values ​​or constants. These values ​​are usually obtained from user input, programmers, the environment, or are the result of program processes.</p>

           <p> The variable that we have created is a memory on the computer. Inside the computer, precisely in the computer memory, there are actually a lot of arranged memory that has an address as a memory marker. Memory addresses are represented by hexadecimal numbers and each address represents one bit.</p>
            
            <p> time we set a variable we are actually requesting memory on the CPU, then the CPU will check and find out which memory addresses are still free and usable. The memory will be given to the program in the form of a memory address. With the meaning that

        <p>In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
          <li>double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.</li>
          <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
          <li>string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
          <li>bool - stores values with two states: true or false"</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>type variable = value;</pre>
        </code>
        <p>Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variable is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.</p>
        <p>Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>int myNum = 15;
            cout << myNum;</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            Variable declaration is the process of setting up or creating variables in program code. To set up a variable we need a data type that is useful for representing the form of the value to be stored and a name (identifier) ​​as an identifier.
        </p>
        <p>You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>int myNum;
            myNum = 15;
            cout << myNum;</pre>
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Local Variable</header>
        <p>
            Local Variables are variables that are usually set within a scope (such as a function). The variable will only be visible and can only be used within that scope.

            Local Variable is Automatic duration which means that the variable will be created when the compiler passes declarations in a scope and is destroyed after leaving the scope.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
            #include <iostream>
            using namespace std;
            
            int main ()
            {
                int id = 1;
                cout << id << endl;
            
                return 0;
            } 
        </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            In our scope it is also possible to do nested scope (Scope inside scope). This will be the same, they live as long as the execution is still in the scope. local variables in the child scope will only live in the child scope, for local variables in the parent scope will live throughout the scope in which it was created, meaning that local variables in the parent scope can be accessed in the child scope.
